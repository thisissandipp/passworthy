# Passworthy

In a sentence - Simple yet secured password manager application.

Passworthy is a no-frills, offline password manager designed for privacy-conscious users. It securely stores passwords locally on your device, ensuring that only you have access to your credentials.

Unlike cloud-based managers, Passworthy requires no logins, no accounts, and no internet connection — your passwords remain encrypted and protected, without compromise.

## Mission

To provide a **secure**, **lightweight**, and **privacy-first password manager** that is accessible to everyone, without the need for cloud storage or subscriptions.

Passworthy exists to serve those who value control over their data, offering a simple yet powerful tool for managing credentials without compromise.

## Why Passworthy?

Most password managers push you toward cloud storage, paid subscriptions, and data tracking. Passworthy takes a different approach—one that puts you in full control.

- 🔒 **Offline & Secure** – Your passwords are stored only on your device, encrypted for maximum security.
- ⚡ **Fast & Lightweight** – No unnecessary bloat, just a simple and efficient password manager.
- 🚫 **No Tracking, No Ads** – Your data is yours. No hidden analytics, no profiling, no third-party access.
- 🛠️ **Open-Source & Transparent** – Built for privacy-first users, with source code available for review.
